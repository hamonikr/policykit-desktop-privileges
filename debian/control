Description: run common desktop actions without password
 This package provides a set of PolicyKit privileges which allow Administrators
 to run common actions without being asked for their password:
 .
  * mounting and checking internal disk drives (through udisks)
  * setting the CPU speed and policy (through the GNOME CPU frequency applet)
  * setting the time and timezone (through the GNOME clock applet or through
    KDE)
  * Adding/changing system-wide NetworkManager connections
  * Update already installed software
  * Configure printers
 .
 It does not change privileges for non-Administrators (users who are not in the
 "admin" or "sudo" group). So this satisfies the typical desktop/laptop use
 case where the user has full control over the hardware anyway.
 .
 This is implemented by shipping a pklocalauthority(8) file.
